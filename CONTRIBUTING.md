## Setting up the dev environment

This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies in it:

```bash
make venv
```


## Running the test suite

This will create a virtual environment and will run the test suite in it using `pytest`. (Note: no need to run `make venv` before this command, it will call it automatically)

```bash
make test
```
